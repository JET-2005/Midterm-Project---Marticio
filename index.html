			My name is Jeth Felmar J. Marticio or you can me "JET", I'm a 1st year BSIT or Bachelor of Science in Information
			Technologies college student in Silliman University. I live in Boloc-Boloc, Sibulan, I'm 19 years old, Born on the 22nd of October 2005. 
			Well, about me, I'm a chill guy who loves to learn more for the better and learn from the mistakes I've made in the past to become a better
			person. My goal is become successful in the future with a stable income with a mind full of wisdom and a heart full of love. 
			I'm intrested in learning more about BSIT subjects and more about programming because in my life I am curious about how computer works 
			and how to code that is why I picked this course, I am also intrested in every sports besides basketball, I lost the spark of playing basketball 
			same with online games because maybe it is part of growing up. For now, I am focusing on building myself, to learn BSIT for my future career, and finding myself. If you want to know me even deeper
